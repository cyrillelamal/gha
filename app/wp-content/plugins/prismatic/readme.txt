== Installation ==

**Installing Prismatic**

1. Make a backup of your database
2. Upload the plugin to your blog and activate
3. Visit the plugin settings to configure options

_[More info on installing WP plugins](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#installing-plugins)_



**Quick Start Guide**

Here is a quick guide to get started with Prismatic:

1. Activate the plugin and visit the Prismatic settings page
2. Choose Prism.js or Highlight.js for syntax highlighting
3. Optionally visit the Prism.js or Highlight.js tab to customize options

You are now ready to go. To add a code snippet to any WP Post or Page:

* If using Gutenberg Block Editor, click on the Prismatic block
* If using Classic Editor, click on the Prismatic TinyMCE button

To get a better idea, view the screenshots on the [Prismatic homepage](https://wordpress.org/plugins/prismatic/).

The Prismatic block or button makes it easy to add your code snippet and choose a language. The plugin automatically will output the correct markup to display your code with syntax highlighting. No code editing required! Note: Advanced usage information provided further down on this page.



**Like the plugin?**

If you like Prismatic, please take a moment to [give a 5-star rating](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/prismatic/reviews/?rate=5#new-post). It helps to keep development and support going strong. Thank you!



**Uninstalling**

Prismatic cleans up after itself. All plugin settings will be removed from your database when the plugin is uninstalled via the Plugins screen. NOTE that uninstalling the plugin will NOT touch any of your post content. Only the plugin options are removed when the plugin is uninstalled via the Plugins screen.



**Restore Default Options**

To restore default plugin options, either uninstall/reinstall the plugin or visit the Prismatic General Settings &gt; Restore default plugin options.



**Usage: Syntax Highlighting**

The Prismatic plugin follows the same conventions used by [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) and [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/). Here are the basic steps:

1. Visit the Prismatic General Settings and choose your library 
2. Visit the settings tab for your chosen library
3. Choose a theme and configure your options

Once the settings are configured, you can enable syntax highlighting for any code snippet by doing one of the following:

* Wrap multi-line code with pre &amp; code tags: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
* Wrap single-line code with code tags: &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;

The plugin also provides a Prismatic Gutenberg block and TinyMCE buttons. So you can add code snippets with a few clicks easily.

__Note:__ Prism.js highlights both multi-line and single-line code snippets. Highlight.js only supports multi-line code snippets.

With the proper markup in place, you can indicate a specific language by adding a class of `language-abc` or `lang-abc` to the &lt;code&gt; tag (where "abc" is the language identifier). For example, to indicate PHP as the language for a single-line code snippet:

	<code class="language-php"><?php echo 'Hello world'; ?></code>

Likewise, to indicate HTML as the language for a multi-line code snippet:

	<pre><code class="language-html">
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Side</th>
				<th>Role</th>
			<tr>
				<td>Darth</td>
				<td>Dark</td>
				<td>Sith</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</code></pre>

Alternately, the language class may be placed on the &lt;pre&gt; tag, for example:

	<pre class="language-html"><code class="optional">
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Side</th>
				<th>Role</th>
			<tr>
				<td>Darth</td>
				<td>Dark</td>
				<td>Sith</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</code></pre>

Note: in the previous example, ignore the `class="optional"` added to the code tag; it is used to prevent markdown from mangling the code example on this web page.

Basically, the prefix of the class names (i.e., "lang-" or "language-") are the same for Prism.js and Highlight.js. The difference is the language identifier (e.g., "css" or "html") used to specify each language. Check out the following "About Prism.js" and "About Highlight.js" sections for more information.

__Note:__ In addition to detecting the `language-` and `lang-` prefixes, Highlight.js also will try to auto-detect the language without it being specified. Plus as an option, you can enable the Highlight.js setting, "Support no-prefix class names" to enable use of language identifiers without any `language-` or `lang-` prefix.

> Pro Tip: Language class names work when added to the &lt;pre&gt; tag for both Prism.js and Highlight.js.



**Usage: Code escaping**

Just like Prism.js and Highlight.js, the Prismatic plugin follows HTML coding standards. To enable code escaping:

1. Visit the Prismatic General Settings and choose your library
2. Enable "Code Escaping" via the settings tab of your chosen library
3. Do one of the following:
	* Wrap multi-line code with pre &amp; code tags: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
	* Wrap single-line code with code tags: &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;

For example, the code snippets included in either of the following markup examples would be escaped (note that the class attribute is not required for code escaping).

This is a single-line example:

	<code class="language-php"><?php echo 'Hello world'; ?></code>

This is a multi-line code example:
	
	<pre><code class="language-html">
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Name</th>
				<th>Side</th>
				<th>Role</th>
			<tr>
				<td>Darth</td>
				<td>Dark</td>
				<td>Sith</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
	</code></pre>

So what exactly happens when the "Code Escaping" options are enabled? Here is a summary that applies to each section (post content, excerpts, and comments):

* __Frontend only__ - code snippets are escaped at runtime (no changes made to content in the database)
* __Admin Area only__ - code snippets are escaped when viewed via the Admin Area (changes will be saved to database if the "Update" or "Publish" button is clicked)
* __Frontend &amp; Admin Area__ - both of the previous are applied
* __None__ - all code escaping is disabled

Note that each library &mdash; Prism.js, Highlight.js, and Plain Flavor &mdash; features its own code-escape settings. So the code-escape settings that are applied depends on the currently active library. Visit the plugin's General Settings to choose your library. Then visit that library's tab to configure its code-escape settings.

When code escaping is enabled for either/both the frontend or Admin Area, the plugin makes the following changes to any code contained within &lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags:

	&                     replaced with &amp;
	<                     replaced with &lt;
	>                     replaced with &gt;
	"                     replaced with &quot;
	'                     replaced with &#039;
	\r                    removed
	trailing whitespace   removed

These are the _only_ changes made to your code, no other changes are made. 

As mentioned, the difference between code escaping on the frontend vs. the Admin Area is that, on the frontend, the above changes are made at runtime and not saved to the database; whereas in the Admin Area, the changes are made when the code is viewed via a content editor, such that any changes made will be saved to the database when the user clicks the "Update" or "Publish" button. Please keep this in mind when choosing your code-escape settings.
		
__Important!__ As explained, enabling code escaping in the Admin Area may result in the escaped code getting saved in the database. This is fine in most cases, but there may be situations where escaping should only happen at runtime. If that is the case, or if you are unsure, choose the "Frontend only" option for the "Code Escaping" setting. The "Frontend only" option only modifies code when displayed on the frontend and does not save any changes to the database.



**Usage: Gutenberg Block Editor**

To highlight a code block using Gutenberg:

1. Select the Prismatic block
2. Select a code language (via sidebar options)
3. Add your code and done.



**Usage: Classic TinyMCE Editor**

To highlight code using the TinyMCE/Visual/Rich-Text Editor:

1. Click the Prismatic button (looks like `<>`)
2. Choose a code language
3. Add your code and click "OK" button

There also is a Prismatic Quicktag button ("pre") for those using the Plain-Text editor.



**Usage: Prism.js Plugins**

Prismatic includes several plugins for Prism.js. You can enable them in the Prism settings. Note that some plugins require action on your part, like adding a class to pre elements. Here is a quick list with links to more information.

* [Line Highlight](https://prismjs.com/plugins/line-highlight/)       - Requires adding `data-line` attribute to the pre element
* [Line Numbers](https://prismjs.com/plugins/line-numbers/)           - Requires adding `line-numbers` class to the pre element
* [Show Language](https://prismjs.com/plugins/show-language/)         - No additional steps required
* [Copy to Clipboard](https://prismjs.com/plugins/copy-to-clipboard/) - No additional steps required
* [Command Line](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/)           - Requires adding `command-line` class to the pre element

Note for adding extra classes: If using the Gutenberg Block Editor, you can add extra classes to your code blocks like so:

1. On the "Edit Post" screen, add the Prismatic block
2. Click the 3-dot (options) button for the block
3. Click "Show more settings"

After these steps, an "Advanced" panel will appear in the sidebar. Toggle it open to find "Additional CSS class(es)". There you can add any extra classes to your code block (like for Line Numbers or Command Line).

Note: in the previous example, ignore the `class="optional"` added to the code tag (for the "Alternate" syntax); it is used to prevent markdown from mangling the code example on this web page.

To disable Prism.js syntax highlighting for any snippet, simply omit the language class. Or, to disable syntax highlighting for a code snippet while also loading the Prism.js stylesheet, add a class of `language-none`, for example:

	<code class="language-none">...</code>

== Upgrade Notice ==

To upgrade Prismatic, remove the old version and replace with the new version. Or just click "Update" from the Plugins screen and let WordPress do it for you automatically.

__Note:__ uninstalling the plugin from the WP Plugins screen results in the removal of all settings from the WP database. 



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Can you add another language for Prism.js or Highlight.js?**

Yes, feel free to [suggest a language](https://plugin-planet.com/support/#contact)


**Does this work with Gutenberg Block Editor?**

Yes, the plugin provides a "Prismatic" block that makes it easy to add code snippets that will be highlighted on the front-end. Also provides "add code" buttons for the Classic TinyMCE (Visual/Text) Editor. Add code, choose a language, done!


**Display syntax-highlighted code inside Block Editor?**

If for some reason you want to view syntax-highlighted code inside of the Block Editor, you can do it with the Classic Block:

1. Select the Classic Block
2. Click on the Prismatic TinyMCE button
3. Enter your code and save changes

The code won't be highlighted initially, but if you refresh the page after making changes, or visit the page again in the future, the code will be displayed with syntax highlighting applied.


**How to syntax highlight code inside of ACF field?**

As of Prismatic version 2.3, code snippets inside of ACF fields are highlighted automatically. Simply add the required class (e.g., `language-php`) just like any other code snippet, and the plugin will detect and highlight the code. To also escape the highlighted code, enable escaping for post content via the setting, Prism &gt; Code Escaping &gt; Content. Note: ACF is supported only on single post views.


**How to make highlighting work with Autoptimize?**

For Prismatic plugin to work with Autoptimize, a script needs to be excluded. For details, check out [this post](https://ncoughlin.com/prismatic-syntax-highlighter-compatibility-autoptimize-plugin/) by Nick Coughlin.


**How to disable block styles on frontend?**

If you are not using Gutenberg Block Editor, you can disable the plugin's block stylesheet. Simply enable the plugin setting, "Block Styles". Save changes and done.

FYI: the Prismatic block styles are included via: `/prismatic/css/styles-blocks.css`


**How to escape nested code tags?**

Currently the only way to display nested `<code>` tags is to use the following shortcode:

`[prismatic_code][/prismatic_code]`

Currently this works only for **inline** `<code>` tags. More details [here](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/sourcecode-with-tags-i-e-nested-tags/#post-13651551).
